1. Remove redundant react-app boilerplate code
2. build these components
2.1 - Roundlist consist of a component called Rounds; Right now has hard-coded data, and needs to be rendered from the db.
 -> Start building an express server to provide an API with endpoints for fetching rounds
 -> Create DB for rounds

--

 create /user/id component
 create /round/id component & endpoint
 create /rounds & /entry endpoints

-- 05/01
 created /entry
 -> needs dropdowns for courses, tracks & tee colors
 -> render db values into these dropdowns
 -> write joins for courses-tracks (1to1) & tracks-tee colors(1to1)

-- 08/01
Add new component to list all rounds, also to practice redux implementation
Added redux; need to create stores, actions & reducers
start refactoring code (see lesson 91)
